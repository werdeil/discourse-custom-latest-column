# Customize the columns in /latest

This discourse component allows you to select which columns are visible on the **/latest** homepage of your Discourse site

Handled columns:
- Views
- Likes
- Replies
- Activity
- Categories (see above)

You can simply enable/disable the columns from the component's settings.

Note: Categories columns handling have been extracted from the following repository:
https://github.com/tshenry/discourse-add-category-column
The only change is the addition of the option in the component settings.
